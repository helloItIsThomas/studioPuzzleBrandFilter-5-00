hello, what am i trying to do this morning?
I am using Float32Array to store the positions.

Now, i want to maximize the efficiency of updating the positions of the images, and re-drawing the images at those positions when they have been changed.

This is separate from getting the brightness values from the image.
I think what would be good for now is to free up the draw loop so it can be constantly running.
