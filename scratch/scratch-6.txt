••• TO DO:
• PRIORITY 1
Have an image already pre-calculated for default,
instead of spending time calculating the same image on each load.

{
    to do this, i think i need to separate the image loading from the brightness calculation.
    imageLoaded() -> recalculateGrid() -> updateCellData() -> create AllThreeGraphics() -> shaderRendering()

    populateGrid() createStatsGui() draw() initGridLoadingScreen() calculateAverageBrightnessP5()
    handleMultFiles() createInput() startRecording() stopRecording() drawIcon() fitImageToWindow()
    scaleDims() updateClock() loadImagesWithP5() mySetup()

    

}

Have a processing / loading screen, prefereably one that displays a grid
and fills in each cell as they is being evaluated.
This should trigger whenever recalculateGrid runs. 

Fix the bug that happens when changing from 2 images to 1 image at runtime.

Implement proper resizing
