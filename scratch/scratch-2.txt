What do i need to do before handoff?

Add a max value for gridResolution

add in 

Have a way to switch between modes:
    1 image in-out
    1 image scaleDynamically
    2 image puzzle transition

Edit the following features on any mode:
    Contrast slider
    clipOutliers toggle
    angle
    xOffset
    offsetWiggle

~~ Change the gridResolution slider to a textbox ~~

~~ Figure out why the images are sometimes blurry
    The images are only blurry when we load in a new image during runtime, and the gridResolution is set to a high number. This causes the image to load in small, and therefore be noticably small when the gridResolution is set to a lower number.
    We can solve this one of three ways:
        1. We can set the gridResolution to 10 right b4 we upload a new image.
        2. We can set tempScaler to the same value every time?
~~            We did this and it seems like it should work.
